        As a full stack developer, my skill set covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        React, Redux, and Ruby on Rails. This expertise enables me to create
        visually appealing and responsive web interfaces while also implementing
        robust back-end functionalities.
        <br />
        I excel at delivering comprehensive web solutions that cater to
        both user experience and business requirements. I am also passionate
        about cutting-edge, pixel-perfect, beatiful interfaces and intuitively
        implemented UX.
